# 👩‍💻 Coding Mums Club Survey Form

In this lab, I created a **Survey Form** using HTML to practice my skills in building accessible and user-friendly web forms. This project is part of my journey through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:

- Using the `<form>` element to collect user input  
- Associating `<label>` elements with form inputs for better accessibility  
- Working with different types of `<input>` fields (`text`, `email`, `number`, `radio`, `checkbox`)  
- Adding `placeholder` text and using the `required` attribute for validation  
- Creating a dropdown menu using `<select>` and `<option>`  
- Adding a `<textarea>` for open-ended feedback  
- Using a submit button with proper form submission behavior

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML5  
- Basic form validation using HTML attributes  

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a fully functional and accessible survey form  
- Apply everything I’ve learned about HTML forms  
- Make the form look and feel personal to my journey as a mum learning to code  


## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser  
3. Fill out the form and test all input validations
